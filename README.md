# Description

A weirdly specific tool to preprocess photos in order to make a timelapse after you got a new haircut.

# How to use

## Generate numeroted photo names

Launch `bash rename.sh path/to/your/photos/folder/with/no/ending/slash` (Note: if you renamed your photo instead of leaving the date as the photo's name your photos might not be in the correct order).

It should create 1.jpg, 2.jpg, etc and put in a folder with a name ending in "\_frames".

## Resize photos

Launch `python3 framer.py path/to/folder/containing/numbered/photos` where the photo names should have been generated by rename.sh

It should use 1.jpg, 2.jpg, etc to create respectively auto_1.jpg, auto_2.jpg, etc. which you can now directly import in probably any editing software and make a timelapse almost instantly.

## Errors

If processing fails for some photos, you can play with the crop values in framer.py to see what gives you the best results (I used photos in portrait format, the default values may not suit your usecase).
